<ul>
<li>The Light Phone 2 is an e-ink 4G phone with a few basic apps. When you are feeling too burdened by your smartphone, it can be a temporary replacement.</li>
<li>Striking in its minimalist design, the Light Phone 2 makes calls, sends messages, sets alarms, and that&#8217;s it.</li>
<li>The phone is currently crowdfunding at Indiegogo for $250 and a list price of $400.</li>

<p>Are you feeling too connected? Do you find yourself heading to bed to get some sleep, but instead <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/blue-light-821900/">scrolling through your phone for hours</a>? Do you feel distracted by your phone in your pocket when you’re out at social engagements as if it’s yearning to be opened and toyed with instead of letting you engage in human interaction? Do you just, you know, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-q3-2017-results-827333/">hate smartphones</a>?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to any of the questions above, you are the target audience for <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2-smartphone-design#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light Phone 2</a>, a crowdfunding project that’s currently raising a ton of money on <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/billion-dollar-company-crowdfunding-804008/">Indiegogo</a>.</p>
<p>The first Light Phone was created by Joe Hollier, an artist, and Kaiwei Tang, a product designer. The two met at an NYC-based <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-march-security-patch-pixel-nexus-843419/">Google</a> incubator in 2014. While trying to think up the “<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/ideation-for-android-developers-700054/">next big app</a>,” the two realized that the last thing they wanted to do was ram another app down peoples&#8217; throats. Instead, they tried to make something that did the opposite, something that pulled people away from their phones and back to real life.</p>

<p>The two invented the Light Phone, an e-ink device that looks like a small <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-hires-man-behind-amazon-kindle-719828/">Kindle</a>. The Light Phone did one thing, which was make phone calls. The duo produced 10,000 Light Phones and now are crowdfunding its successor, the Light Phone 2.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/billion-dollar-company-crowdfunding-804008/" title="It&#8217;s not ok for billion-dollar companies to crowdfund"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/anker-nebula.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/anker-nebula.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">It&#8217;s not ok for billion-dollar companies to crowdfund</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

Crowdfunding has traditionally been a platform where the little guys go to get a leg up. Creators get the chance to share their ideas, and we’re able to do something positive if we like what we …</div></div></div></div>
<p>This new iteration of the Light Phone will do a bit more, although what it will exactly do is not yet set in stone. The duo knows that they want the phone to make calls, send text messages, and set alarms, but other features may make it into the final product. For example, some sort of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-travel-apps-for-android-2-247868/">navigation app</a> would be helpful, or maybe a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-weather-apps-and-weather-widgets-for-android-256942/">weather service app</a>.</p>
<p>But there are some things that will absolutely not be on the phone, like all social media apps, advertising, email, and news feeds.</p>
<p>The Light Phone 2 is not designed to completely replace your smartphone. It is instead supposed to offer you the choice between being fully connected and being partially connected. This partial connection is what Light Phone refers to as “going light.” If you’re <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-users-likely-negatively-judge-android-836280/">going out on a date</a>, for example, you don’t need all the features of your smartphone potentially interrupting your evening. So you leave your primary phone at home and grab your Light Phone instead.</p>

<p><img src="//i.ytimg.com/vi/CJvWm6VAjUE/hqdefault.jpg"><span class="youtube-play"><i class="youtube-play-icon"></i></span></div>
</div>
<p>There are some major hurdles the company faces with its product though. The first hurdle is the fact that most carriers do not allow you to duplicate SIM cards, so that means your Light Phone 2 and your regular phone would not be able to have the same number at the same time. A simple solution to this is to hot swap your SIM from one phone to the other, but that may not be practical for some people.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper left"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/differentiate-bezel-less-phones-830856/" title="5 ways phones can still be unique in the bezel-less age"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnePlus-5T-vs-LG-G6-1-of-12.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnePlus-5T-vs-LG-G6-1-of-12.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">5 ways phones can still be unique in the bezel-less age</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

Bezel-less was probably the defining term of the 2017 smartphone industry, one I take no pride in helping to spread. The look was everywhere as manufacturers raced to offer consumers extra screen real estate, and I'm …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Another issue is the price. The featured perk for the Indiegogo campaign is $250 for a Light Phone 2, which is a discounted price. The MSRP for the phone when it officially hits the market will be $400, which is considerably expensive for what is essentially a really fancy <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/bill-would-make-prepaid-phone-owners-register-682373/">burner phone</a>. It also seems a tad overpriced when you consider a Kindle, which is roughly the same concept but without a SIM card, <a href="http://tyvm.ly/TQW85" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs $100</a>.</p>
<p>However, some consideration should be given to the design of the Light Phone 2, which does look incredibly sleek and beautiful. It indeed would turn some heads if you took it out of your pocket in a group of friends.</p>
<p>The specs of the Light Phone 2 are below but obviously could change depending on how well the Indiegogo campaign performs. As of the publishing of this article, the campaign is nearly 300% funded at about $750,000, with 19 days left to go.</p>

<div class="aa_tldr_text"></p>
<ul>
<li>Spotify users are receiving emails from the company about &#8220;abnormal activity&#8221; and encouraging them to download the official Spotify app.</li>
<li>This is a clear indication that Spotify is beginning to crack down on members who use third-party apps to get Spotify premium features for free.</li>
<li>With Spotify soon selling shares of the company on the open market, it must abandon its conflicting views on internet piracy and crack down on TOS violations.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-smart-speaker-839048/">Spotify</a> users are reportedly <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/spotify-emails-warning-to-pirates-using-hacked-apps-180305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receiving emails</a> from the company about “abnormal activity” detected on their accounts. While the email doesn’t use the words “piracy,” “theft,” or “stealing,” it’s hard not to connect the dots: Spotify is cracking down on members who use modified apps to get premium Spotify features for free.</p>
<p>Starting a Spotify account is easy: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the app</a>, give the company your email, pick a password, and you’re listening to all the music you can handle. However, there are a few notable limitations. You can only listen on shuffle, meaning you can’t select which song you specifically want to hear, and your listening experience will be interrupted by ads every so often.</p>
<p>To remove these limitations, you need to pay for <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a premium Spotify account</a>, currently set at $9.99 per month for individuals or $14.99 per month for a family account.</p>
<p>Or you could just install any one of the illegally modified apps online that let you listen to whatever you want ad-free without paying a dime (no, we won’t be linking to them in this article).</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-music-streaming-apps-for-android-213818/" title="10 best music streaming apps and music streaming services for Android"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AA-Google-Play-Music-Music-Library.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AA-Google-Play-Music-Music-Library.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">10 best music streaming apps and music streaming services for Android</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">
Music streaming has grown up tremendously since its inception and is now among the best ways to listen to music. Many streaming services let you listen for free, which has helped curb the need for …</div></div></div></div>
<p>There are more than 159 million Spotify users around the world, and according to numbers <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-70-million-paid-subs-827866/">published by the company in December</a>, about 71 million of those members pay for a premium service. That leaves about 88 million members who may or may not be freeloading using a modified app.</p>
<p>These modified apps have existed almost as long as Spotify itself, but this is the first time the company has officially started to crack down on users themselves. Earlier this month, Spotify ordered a takedown of one of the more popular piracy apps on <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/add-a-github-library-to-android-studio-using-maven-jcenter-jitpack-777050/">Github</a>, a request with which Github complied.</p>
<p>It can’t be a coincidence that the piracy Spotify has been fine to look away from for years is all of a sudden a priority right before it&#8217;s about to start <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-files-for-ipo-842319/">selling shares in Spotify stock</a> on the open market. By going public, Spotify is going to have to consistently raise revenue to appease stockholders; it will be hard to do that if there are millions of users getting the service for free.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper left"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-files-for-ipo-842319/" title="Spotify files for IPO amidst increasing competition from Apple and Google"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Spotify-3.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Spotify-3.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">Spotify files for IPO amidst increasing competition from Apple and Google</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">



After filing IPO documents in December, Spotify has finally announced its plans to go public through a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The company intends to list its shares on New …</div></div></div></div>
<p>One of the lead developers of Spotify’s software is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Strigeus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ludvig Strigeus</a>, whose original claim to fame was the creation of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-torrent-apps-android-711563/">uTorrent</a>. For those of you who aren’t familiar with internet piracy, uTorrent is an extremely popular BitTorrent client that is a favorite way for internet pirates to download illegal torrents of copyrighted material.</p>
<p>With an integral member of the Spotify team rooted in internet piracy, it’s easy to see why the company might have been loath to crack down on piracy of its own software. But the company is going public, and that means the gloves are coming off.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-843556" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates.png" alt="" width="600" height="619" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates.png 600w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates-300x310.png 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates-16x16.png 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates-32x32.png 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates-28x28.png 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates-54x56.png 54w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates-62x64.png 62w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/spotify-pirates-194x200.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>According to <em>TorrentFreak</em>, some users are reporting after getting the warning email that their accounts no longer work. Other users say they see no change in their account status. To avoid repercussions on your Spotify account, you should uninstall any third-party Spotify apps and then install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official app</a> from the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-use-google-play-store-android-841792/">Google Play Store</a>. By signing in with your account on that app, you can be assured that you will be using Spotify within the limits of its terms of service.</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Home and Home Mini now support hands-free calling in the UK.</li>
<li>Voice Match and callerID supported from day one.</li>
<li>Home Mini down to £39 at Google Store and various retailers to celebrate the rollout.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr>
<p>Google has been slowly rolling out new features to Home smart speakers outside the US and Canada and that continues today with the news that <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-sales-google-assistant-827945/">Home</a> devices in the UK now support <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-homes-calling-feature-might-coming-soon-793963/">hands-free calling</a> over Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The search giant had <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-coming-japan-hands-free-calling-due-uk-later-2017-804699/">previously suggested</a> call functionality would arrive in the region in late 2017, but patient Home owners are unlikely to care now it has officially arrived. The full rollout is expected to be completed in the next week, so make sure your Home or Home Mini is online to receive the latest firmware update.<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-vs-amazon-echo-785590/" title="Google Home vs Amazon Echo &#8211; Is Google finally the king?"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Google-Home-Amazon-Echo.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Google-Home-Amazon-Echo.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">Google Home vs Amazon Echo &#8211; Is Google finally the king?</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">The Google Home smart assistant was released just over a year ago, and a lot has changed since then. At the time of launch, a lot of people were disappointed at its ability vs the …</div></div></div></div></p>
<p>To celebrate the launch, Google is slashing the price of the smaller <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-mini-specs-price-release-date-features-804238/">Home Mini</a>&nbsp;to just £39 (down £10).</p>
<p>The limited time offer runs from now until March 12th via the official Google Store and retailers John Lewis, Argos, and Currys PC World.</p>
<p>Starting a hands-free call using Home is as easy as it is on mobile. All you’ll need to do is activate Google Assistant with “Ok Google” and say the name of the contact you wish to call. Users can also register their mobile number as callerID after the first call has been placed.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://dgit.com/google-assistant-options-51530/">More:&nbsp;What is Google Assistant? How can you use it?</a></h4>
<p>In addition, UK users get to enjoy Voice Match support from day one. That means if you ask Home to call mum it’ll know to call <em>your</em> mum (it is Mother’s Day in the UK next week, remember), even if your Home has <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-multi-user-support-uk-782968/">more than one registered user</a>.</p>
<p>As well as family and friends, Home can also call businesses and restaurants across the UK, however premium rate and emergency numbers are not supported.</p>
<p>The rollout means Home has caught up with Amazon&#8217;s Echo devices. Calling has been supported by the Alexa-powered speaker range in the UK since last October. The only thing missing now is a UK release date for the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-max-review-839235/">Google Home Max</a>&nbsp;which is still exclusive to the US market.</p>

<p></div><hr>
<p>After announcing during <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-of-mwc-2018-841806/">MWC 2018</a> that more Android smartphones will eventually support <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-lens-772814/">Google Lens</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-march-security-patch-pixel-nexus-843419/">Google</a> kept its word and started rolling out the feature for devices that have Google Photos installed.</p>
<p>This is a staged rollout, so do not fret if you do not get the update right away. Also, certain smartphones will eventually support Lens through Google Assistant, including flagship devices from <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-acquires-kngine-ai-bixby-843389/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-product-strategy-842091/">LG</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-virtual-assistant-chinese-market-hiassistant-843522/">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lenovo-motorola-razr-revival-841898/">Motorola</a>, HMD Global/<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-9-2018-september-launch-premium-features-843090/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/sony-design-841991/">Sony</a>.</p>
<p>Lens will also be available for iOS devices, but Google did not say when the roll out would start.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rolling out today, Android users can try Google Lens to do things like create a contact from a business card or get more info about a famous landmark. To start, make sure you have the latest version of the Google Photos app for Android: <a href="https://t.co/KCChxQG6Qm">https://t.co/KCChxQG6Qm</a><br />

<p>The road getting to this point has been a long one. Google <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-lens-772814/">first announced</a> Lens during its 2017 I/O developer conference and said the feature would roll out within Photos for Pixel smartphones. Lens then made its way to Google Assistant <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-lens-pixel-users-818352/">in November</a>, but remained a Pixel-exclusive feature. You do not need to snap a picture for Lens to work in Assistant, since you can just tap an object in the viewfinder and have Lens try to identify it.</p>
<p>Whether you use it in Photos or Assistant, Lens uses machine learning to identify real-world objects. Lens also pulls off neat tricks, such as scanning QR codes and connecting to Wi-Fi networks by scanning the password on the back of your router.</p>

<p>Lens was very much experimental and temperamental, but Google continues to make fixes and add more features. <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2018/03/06/google-lens-now-describes-landmarks-and-creates-contacts-from-business-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Next Web</em></a> reported that the most recent update allows Lens to identify and provide contextual information to landmarks. You can also use Lens to create contact information from business cards.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-lens-improvements-ar-experiences-822580/">teased features</a> like integrated AR experiences, improvements to natural object recognition, and buying objects that Lens recognizes. We should hear more about these features, along with others, during Google I/O 2018 in May.</p>

<p>I have a soft spot for <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>. There’s just something extremely pleasing about a working <b>set of calculations</b>, or even a <strong>cheeky vlookup</strong>.</p>
<p>The thing is, knowing how to change the number of decimal places and putting together a good color scheme can <strong>only get you so far</strong>. If you want to really <strong>harness the power of Excel</strong>, you need to know your onions when it comes to <strong>VBA</strong>.</p>
<p>Fortunately <strong>help is at hand</strong>, and it’s even <strong>on offer</strong>. Today’s deal is the <a href="http://andauth.co/jUvJDR"><strong>Microsoft VBA Bundle</strong></a>.

<p>Google&#8217;s list of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-enterprise-recommended-lists-best-business-phones-839476/">Android Enterprise Recommended</a> devices grew a bit larger today as Nokia announced the newest trio of additions: the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-8-sirocco-review-841421/">Nokia 8 Sirocco</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-7-plus-2-840105/">Nokia 7 Plus</a>, and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-hmd-global-us-launch-8-sirocco-7-plus-mwc-841496/">Nokia 6</a>. They join the Nokia 8 and bring the total number of Android Enterprise Recommended devices to 25.</p>
<p>The Nokia 8 Sirocco, Nokia 7 Plus, and Nokia 6 were announced during MWC 2018 and are not surprising additions to the business-friendly device list. HMD Global, which develops and markets devices under the Nokia name, emphasizes timely security updates with Nokia-branded Android smartphones.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It just so happens that security is one of the key tenets of the Android Enterprise Recommended program. Manufacturers must deliver Android security updates within 90 days of release from Google, for a minimum of three years. Manufacturers must also support bulk deployment of Android devices, including zero-touch enrollment, and have a consistent application experience in managed profiles and on managed devices.</p>
<p>As for devices, they must support the minimum hardware specifications for Android 7.0+ devices and be available unlocked from either the manufacturer or reseller.</p>
<p>Google hopes to add different types of devices over time, including rugged devices, mobile carriers, system integrators, and enterprise mobility management providers. For the search giant, the goal is presumably is for companies to stick with Android rather than them jump ship to iOS.</p>

<p>HMD Global, meanwhile, no doubt hopes to use the Android Enterprise Recommended program to further buff its growing reputation for timely OS upgrades and security patches.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[What's the truth about this supposed threat to human health and happiness? Is there really anything to worry about here? As with most such things, the answer is yes — and no.]]></description>
	<media:content name="AndroidAuthority" url="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/samsung-quantum-dots-300x169.jpg" medium="image" />			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-836855" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Blue_LIght-e1518372880382.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="379" /><a href="http://www.aoa.org/images/news/Blue_LIght.jpg" rel="nofollow" rel="lightbox[821900]">AOA</a></p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been living completely off the grid and away from the joys of the internet for years (if you have, welcome back. Just to bring you up to speed, the Cubs didn&#8217;t repeat), you&#8217;ve no doubt been bombarded by stories of the awful dangers of blue light. Especially the blue light that comes out of all those little pieces of tech we so adore.</p>
<p>Apparently, all this blue light can make you lose sleep, lose hair, lose your cool, and experience uneven tire wear, as well as raft of far worse problems. Seriously though, some scaremongering sites claim that blue light can cause retinal damage and increase your risk of cancer and heart disease. It&#8217;s almost enough to make you throw your smartphone, laptop, and TV into the nearest dumpster and commit to becoming the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedediah_Smith">Jedediah Smith</a>.</p>
<p>But is there really anything to worry about here? As with most things, the answer is yes and no — it&#8217;s complicated.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-794709" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-840x472.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="472" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-840x472.jpg 840w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-768x431.jpg 768w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-32x18.jpg 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-28x16.jpg 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-56x31.jpg 56w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-64x36.jpg 64w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-712x400.jpg 712w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-1000x562.jpg 1000w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-792x446.jpg 792w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-770x433.jpg 770w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android-356x200.jpg 356w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Night-Mode-Night-Light-Android.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, most of the articles on the subject point back to some studies done a couple of years ago by researchers at Harvard Medical School. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1232">This paper</a> drew a link between nighttime<em> </em>&#8220;blue light&#8221; exposure and interruptions to peoples&#8217; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm">circadian rhythms</a>, which basically govern our sleep cycles and the related aspects of our day/night existence. That&#8217;s where the scarier claims come from. The researchers never claimed exposure to blue light directly caused cancer, heart disease, or any of the other terrible things, but messing around with the body&#8217;s circadian rhythms can increase your chances of all of these ailments.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/night-light-slider-773348/" title="Night Light adds a slider to control intensity [Diving into Android O]"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screenshot_20170517-220649.png)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screenshot_20170517-220649.png" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">Night Light adds a slider to control intensity [Diving into Android O]</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">Night Light was a new feature specific to the Google Pixel in Android N which gave users the ability to reduce the blue light channel on their phone. While this feature was very useful for …</div></div></div></div>
<p>In other words, all the blue light itself can do is upset those rhythms (and then only if the exposure comes at night). It&#8217;s the long-term alteration of your body&#8217;s natural cycles — which can be caused by a number of things in addition to blue light exposure — that is the real problem.</p>
<p>So no, exposure to blue light is not a health hazard, and it&#8217;s especially not true that our tech toys are particular dangers. If exposure to blue light alone was hazardous, you&#8217;d be at great risk just by being outside during the day; natural sunlight, of course, contains its share of the blue wavelengths, and in a much higher intensity than any phone or TV at that.</p>
<blockquote class="quote_new right" style="color: #39d266; border-color: #39d266;"><p>If exposure to blue light alone was hazardous, you'd be at great risk just by being outside during the day.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what&#8217;s different about blue light exposure at night? In addition to rod and cone cells, our eyes have a third type of photoreceptor cell: the intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGCs)<em>. </em>These ipRGCs are particularly sensitive to blue light and are basically there to help the brain regulate circadian rhythms, control the release of melatonin (a hormone responsible for the regulation of sleep cycles), and even control the response of the pupils to light.</p>

<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be all that surprising. In the evolutionary history of the human species, the development of artificial light sources is a very, very recent thing. Before Thomas Edison, if you were seeing things by sunlight (rich in blue light), it was obviously daytime. After the sun went down, the only decent light source we had was fire — for most of that time, the light of the tribe&#8217;s campfires and torches, and only much later candles and oil lamps. But all of these sources lack significant blue wavelengths. Even Edison&#8217;s incandescent bulbs were a good deal &#8220;redder&#8221; than daylight.</p>
<div class="clear"></div><blockquote class="quote_new center" style="color: #39d266; border-color: #39d266;"><p>We evolved with systems that associated blue light with daytime, and a lack of blue light with night</p></blockquote><div class="clear"></div>
<p>We evolved with systems that associated blue light with daytime, and a lack of blue light with night, so this became one of the primary means our bodies have of setting their internal &#8220;clocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last few decades we&#8217;ve started to change that. Fluorescent lighting relies on UV light, exciting a &#8220;white&#8221; phosphor, a mix of chemicals which emit blue and yellow light to give the perception of white. Fluorescents never became popular for home lighting, especially in areas we frequent at night, but LEDs did. Like fluorescent tubes, &#8220;white&#8221; LEDs have considerable blue content in their output spectrum, as a combination of a blue LED with a yellow phosphor coating.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-836860" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum.png" alt="" width="840" height="523" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum.png 692w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum-300x187.png 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum-16x10.png 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum-32x20.png 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum-28x17.png 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum-56x35.png 56w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum-64x40.png 64w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/led-spectrum-321x200.png 321w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7ach.png" rel="nofollow" rel="lightbox[821900]">Source</a></p>
<p>In just a decade, the reddish glow of incandescents has been replaced by a veritable flood of &#8220;blue-rich&#8221; light sources around us after sundown. It&#8217;s little wonder we&#8217;re feeling the effects of this and looking for some solutions. That doesn&#8217;t mean we need to be in a panic about any and all exposure to these sources. Again, if blue light itself was such a heath hazard, the sun would&#8217;ve done us all in long ago.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really changed is that we now have a lot of light sources — including, but definitely not<em> </em>limited to, all of our favorite little bits of tech — producing light at the wavelengths that could interfere with our sleep cycles. Messing those up is a very bad idea. So what can we do about it?</p>
<p>Getting rid of all of these blue-light sources would certainly do the trick, but I doubt it&#8217;s going to be a very popular option unless you&#8217;re looking for a lead role in the next Alaskan-bush reality show. Instead, we&#8217;re going to have to come up with some alternate means of peaceful co-existence. The most obvious change may also be one of the most effective: get away from the tech as you get close to bedtime. Put down the phone, leave the tablet on its charger, and resist the temptation to get in one more game of <em>Call of Grand Theft Mario </em>before you turn in for the night. <blockquote class="quote_new left" style="color: #39d266; border-color: #39d266;"><p>The most obvious change may also be one of the most effective: get away from the tech as you get close to bedtime. </p></blockquote></p>
<p>You really don&#8217;t need to take the tech to bed with you. Many people like to read a bit before going to sleep, but there are these things called &#8220;books,&#8221; which emit little if any blue light. Some e-readers also use reflective displays which don&#8217;t have any blue-light emission.</p>
<p>Apart from those, there are other solutions which still let you keep the tech but do away with the blue light. These come in two main forms: filters (including eyewear) that cut out the blue wavelengths of light, preventing them from ever reaching your eye and causing trouble, and some apps which simply cut back on the amount of blue light your devices produce.</p>
<p>The problem with eliminating all the blue light, is it will create a very noticeable yellow tint (which happens when &#8220;white&#8221; light loses its blue components). The less yellow tint you see, the more blue gets through to your eyes (even then, a reduction in blue light may be all you need). Obviously anything that changes the color balance of what your screens produce or your eyes receive isn&#8217;t going to be great for color accuracy. If you need accurate color, you&#8217;re just going to have to do that work during the day (or surrender and adjust to the night shift permanently).</p>
<p>None of this addresses the potential problem of growing LED use in home lighting. Not all LED lighting has<em> </em>to have this problem though. Light fixtures with RGB LEDs which permit their color adjustment can, of course, be set to provide a &#8220;warmer&#8221; (less blue) color balance whenever desired. The standard LED bulb, though, produces a veritable ton of blue light whenever it&#8217;s in use. So even if you limit your device usage at night, you&#8217;ve still got a problem.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still no evidence of a direct health hazard, but sleep-cycle disruption may be a distinct possibility. The one potential saving grace here is that we don&#8217;t generally look directly at such overhead sources, instead mostly seeing their light reflected from surfaces which may absorb a good deal of the troublesome short wavelengths. If you find yourself having difficulties in getting to sleep, limiting nighttime exposure to this sort of lighting is also something to think about.</p>

<p>How concerned are you by blue light? What steps do you take to limit your exposure?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 03/06/2018, 3:30 P.M. EST:</strong> Facebook made a statement regarding this BlackBerry lawsuit. The statement comes from Paul Grewal, the deputy general counsel for Facebook:</p>
<blockquote><p>“BlackBerry’s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, BlackBerry is now looking to tax the innovation of others. We intend to fight.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that Facebook is not mincing words when it comes to this particular lawsuit.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Original Article</strong>: Today, in a Los Angeles Federal Court, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-lawsuit/blackberry-files-lawsuit-against-facebook-whatsapp-and-instagram-idUSKCN1GI2J2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackBerry, Ltd. filed a lawsuit</a> against Facebook, Inc. for infringing a patent on its messaging technology. The lawsuit calls out <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/now-can-add-friends-ongoing-video-chat-facebook-messenger-839412/">Facebook Messenger</a> as well as Facebook-owned properties like <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/uh-oh-quoted-whatsapp-messages-can-be-seen-even-after-original-message-has-been-deleted-838980/">WhatsApp</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/hidden-portrait-mode-instagram-selfie-game-843427/">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/blackberry-less-million-phone-sold-2017-841179/">BlackBerry</a> has attempted “several years” of dialog with Facebook over the alleged violation of BlackBerry patents. Presumably, those dialogs haven’t been fruitful, and BlackBerry sees no other choice but to take Facebook to court.</p>
<p>Though the specifics of the lawsuit are unavailable, it’s highly likely that the intellectual property patent(s) BlackBerry is suing over relate to its <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/bbm-for-android-full-review-video-285624/">BlackBerry Messenger (BBM)</a> service. Using BBM, BlackBerry users could send messages to each other without using traditional SMS or MMS protocols, a favorite feature in the time before unlimited texting became a given with pretty much any mobile service plan. BBM was eventually ported to Android.</p>

Back in 2016, the budget phone maker TCL bought the rights to create BlackBerry phones. Its first flagship device under this arrangement, the BlackBerry KeyOne, launched last year during Mobile World Congress 2017. Now at …</div></div></div></div>
<p>However, if BlackBerry is suing Facebook specifically over technology present in BBM, shouldn’t it also be suing <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-will-sell-zagat-review-site-infatuation-843218/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-vs-google-competition-836686/">Apple</a>, and the many other companies that have similar messaging apps? Or is there something specific about Facebook&#8217;s properties that brought on this lawsuit?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, until the full lawsuit transcript goes online, we can only speculate what BlackBerry is after.</p>
<p>As of now, Facebook has made no public comment on the lawsuit. We’ll update this post as soon as any new information surfaces.</p>

<div class="aa_tldr_text"></p>
<ul>
<li>By examing the firmware of EMUI 8.1, <em>XDA Developers</em> discovered that Huawei is creating a virtual assistant for the Chinese market.</li>
<li>Both Google&#8217;s and Amazon&#8217;s virtual assistants do not support Chinese languages, leaving China as an untapped market.</li>
<li>While Huawei has made no official announcement of its virtual assistant, the firmware code makes it seem inevitable that we&#8217;ll hear about it soon.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr>
<p>While most of the world thinks of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/leader-alexa-ai-jumps-ship-amazon-google-842481/">Amazon’s Alexa</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/features-coming-google-assistant-including-support-30-languages-840113/">Google Assistant</a> when it comes to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-vs-siri-vs-bixby-vs-amazon-alexa-vs-cortana-best-virtual-assistant-showdown-796205/">virtual assistants</a>, not everyone finds them so useful: neither platform currently understands Chinese. Yes, you can ask both assistants to translate something into Chinese (and Amazon has <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-seriously-exploring-star-trek-like-translation-service-842550/">some big plans when it comes to translation</a>), but you can’t ask the systems a question in Chinese.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-ceo-competitors-using-politics-842801/">Huawei</a> is apparently looking to jump into this untapped market by creating its own virtual assistant specifically for China. There are multiple international Huawei products that integrate either Google Assistant or Alexa, but not in the versions sold in Chinese markets. If Huawei had its own virtual assistant, it wouldn’t have to wait for Google and Amazon to add Chinese language support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/huawei-google-assistant-alexa-chinese-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>XDA Developers</em></a> found that, apparently, Huawei has a virtual assistant called HiAssistant that will roll out in future Chinese-market Huawei smartphones, such as the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p20-plus-826117/">P20 and P20 Plus</a>. The information comes from firmware files taken from the Chinese version of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mate-10-pro-review-807465/">Huawei’s Mate 10</a> EMUI 8.1 release, which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p20-pictures-leak-3-cameras-839453/" title="Exclusive: First pictures of the Huawei P20 leak, could feature three rear cameras"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Huawei-P20-prototype-leak-12.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Huawei-P20-prototype-leak-12.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">Exclusive: First pictures of the Huawei P20 leak, could feature three rear cameras</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

The Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro were stylish smartphones. The Pro even won our Phone of the Year 2017 award. Huawei’s next flagship looks like it could continue that trend. We got our …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Now, there are some caveats here. First, the assistant will only run on devices with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-the-kirin-970s-npu-gary-explains-824423/">Kirin 970 SoC</a>, as other chips in Huawei devices do not have a dedicated NPU (neural processing unit) to run the full-blown virtual assistant. Also, the Android version must be EMUI 8.1, the phone must be designed to be sold in the Chinese market, and you must be able to speak and understand Chinese, clearly.</p>
<p>Some Chinese users might know of the app <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mediapad-m3-review-713646/">HiVoice</a> that comes preinstalled on some Huawei devices. With HiVoice, Chinese-speaking users can do simple things like ask for the GPS location of the device, make a phone call, etc. HiAssistant will be a much more advanced version of HiVoice, similar to how Google Assistant is an advanced version of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-now-explore-interests-test-708894/">Google Now</a>.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-ceo-competitors-using-politics-842801/" title="Huawei CEO calls out competitors “using politics” to kill U.S. deal"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Richard-Yu-holding-Kirin-970-aa.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Richard-Yu-holding-Kirin-970-aa.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">Huawei CEO calls out competitors “using politics” to kill U.S. deal</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">



Richard Yu, the CEO of the consumer products division at Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei, recently made some controversial comments at Mobile World Congress 2018. When pressed by CNBC journalists to comment on the roadblocks the company …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Using HiAssistant, a user will be able to control nearly every setting on the device with their voice, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, volume levels, brightness, etc. You will also be able to search for food, airplane tickets, navigation routes, videos, albums, movies, TV shows, and more.</p>
<p>Likely to be included with HiAssistant will be HiVision, which seems to be a clone of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-lens-improvements-ar-experiences-822580/">Google Lens</a>. Using your phone’s camera, you can frame a shot around an object and HiVision will give you more information about that object. For example, you could focus your shot on a toy a child is playing with at the park, and HiVision will tell you what that toy is and how to buy it for your own child.</p>
<p>Huawei has, as of yet, made no official announcement of HiAssistant, so all of this should be taken with a grain of salt. However, with <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-p20-likely-revealed-paris-march-27-834367/">the launch of the P20 and P20 Plus</a> only a few weeks away, we can most likely expect to get more news about HiAssistant soon, since those devices will presumably be some of the first to support the new assistant.</p>

<div class="aa_tldr_text"></p>
<ul>
<li>Development code in Android P points to a feature enabling you to use your phone as a wireless keyboard or mouse.</li>
<li>You can do this currently in Android, but only if you root your device first. This new feature would eliminate the need to root.</li>
<li>While not exactly a highly demanded feature, it would be incredibly useful to use your phone as a mouse in certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<p></div><hr>
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-p-bluetooth-keyboard-mouse/">Over at <em>XDA Developers</em></a>, Android enthusiasts have been working tirelessly to round up all the rumors of upcoming features in <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-p-dev-preview-preemptive-call-blocking-release-843030/">Android P</a>, the next iteration of the Android operating system. It looks like one of those features will be the ability to use your phone as <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/adding-bluetooth-to-your-app-742538/">a Bluetooth input device</a>, like a wireless mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-p-bluetooth-keyboard-mouse/">the recent <em>XDA</em> blog post</a> to get the nitty-gritty details, but essentially the code to perform wireless input functions has been present in Android since 2016. The Android team just never turned the feature on. Why, we don’t know, but it looks all but certain that the function will finally get switched on <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-begins-i-o-2018-scavenger-hunt-832304/">whenever Android P makes its debut</a>.</p>
<p>Technically, rooted devices have had this feature for quite a while. Simply <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-root-apps-android-269022/">root your phone</a>, download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.z2software.bluetoothpatcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluetooth Plus app</a>, and then take your pick from any of the Bluetooth mouse/keyboard apps available on the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-use-google-play-store-android-841792/">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-p-camera-restrictions-839076/" title="Android P will prevent apps from using your camera or microphone without telling you (Updated)"></a><div class="ra-image" style="background-image: url(https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pixel-2-XL-second-opinion-11.jpg)"><img class="hidden" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pixel-2-XL-second-opinion-11.jpg" alt="related article"></div><h4 class="ra-title">Android P will prevent apps from using your camera or microphone without telling you (Updated)</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

Update (02/21): Another open source commit has been unearthed which suggests that Android P will also stop idle background from accessing your device's microphone.

According (once again) to XDA Developers, the privacy measure will follow a …</div></div></div></div>
<p>However, making the feature built into Android will enable users to do this without rooting their phone, which is a big deal for people who are not tech savvy enough to root their device or who simply don’t want to go through the hassle.</p>
<p>You may or may not see any real advantage to using your phone as an HID (human interface device), but for people who give lots of presentations, it would be quite useful. Not having to carry around a wireless mouse with you to navigate through a presentation would be nice indeed. And people who use desktops as their media center control might like to use their phone to navigate around rather than keeping a wireless mouse on their coffee table.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we won’t know 100% for sure if this feature will be present in Android P until Google announces as such, but the code seems to support that certainty.</p>
<p>Now, the real question is: will it be Android Pie, Android Pop, or Android Popsicle?</p>
