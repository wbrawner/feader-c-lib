I have purchased the white label software and need it implemented across all platforms:<br /><br /><br />
Web // Mobile Web <br />
IOS (publish to IOS store)<br />
Android (publish to Android Market)<br />
Desktop<br /><br /><br />
There will be some customizations I&#039;ll need you to make specific to my website, but generally, the install process is as straightforward as the installation PDF describes. <br /><br />
I have attempted to install Comet Chat twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I was successful,&nbsp;&nbsp;but the most recent time resulted in an error that slowed down my whole website and I was forced to uninstall Cometchat. <br /><br />
I&#039;ll need you to delete all old instances and directories on my server and install a fresh new copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />
You will probably have to stay in frequent communication with the Comet Staff support team to retrieve information relevant to the installation process.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#039;ll be using an email address that I have access to when you do so, so I can be current with the communication back and forth.<br /><br />

I have templates (appearances and &amp;quot;running&amp;quot; of the app). 9 images accompanied by explanations.<br /><br />
I would like you to provide me with simple, fast and efficient tools that would allow me<br />
to handle the texts, to manage the elements which are related to the texts, etc.<br />
Can do it independently without having to go through an external resource.<br /><br />
Many updates will be done because there will be added versions, added words, etc. On a regular basis. All at my own pace. So, it&#039;s important to be able to deliver updates myself.<br /><br />
If you have questions I am at your disposal.<br />
Giving explanations in a video would be a major asset.<br /><br />
I would like start the project with you this week.<br /><br />
