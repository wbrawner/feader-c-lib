    <title>Google Home and Home Mini get hands-free calling in the UK</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home-and-home-mini-get-hands-free-calling-uk</link>
    <description>The Home Mini is also on sale for &amp;pound;39.

I use my Google Home every single day for a variety of things, but one feature that continues to put a smile on my face each time I use it is the ability to makes hands-free voice calls. This is something that&#039;s been available in the United States since last August, and now it&#039;s finally making its way to the UK.



Whether you have a Google Home or Google Home Mini, you can now use your voice to call any of your contacts or businesses that are listed on Google Search/Maps. Also, after you make your first call with Google Home, you can open the Home app on your phone and link your mobile number so that&#039;s what people see when you make a hands-free call.

Placing a call is as easy as saying &quot;Hey Google, call Mum&quot;, and because Google Home knows your voice, it&#039;ll know to call your mum rather than your partner&#039;s or your roommate&#039;s.

    <title>BlackBerry sues Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp for patent infringements</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/blackberry-sues-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-patent-infringements</link>
    <description>Facebook will be contesting the suit.

Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are three of the biggest names in the social media space, and they&#039;re all being sued by BlackBerry for infringing on patents the company holds for its BlackBerry Messenger app.



BlackBerry officially filed the lawsuit on Tuesday, March 6, 2018, in Los Angeles, CA, and the company is requesting that the claims are heard by a jury in court.

The lawsuit measures in at a hefty 117-pages, and it claims that Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp:


  Created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry&#039;s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features that made BlackBerry&#039;s products such a critical and commercial success in the first place.


Facebook has already announced that it&#039;ll be contesting the lawsuit, with the company&#039;s Deputy General Counsel, Paul Grewal, saying:


  BlackBerry&#039;s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business....</description>

    <title>Best Accessories for Razer Phone</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-razer-phone</link>
    <description>

Looking to accessorize your Razer Phone? Here&#039;s a good place to start.

What can turn a good phone experience into a great phone experience is often what else you can add to it. You have to accessorize!

In the case of the Razer Phone, one of our current favorites, there are some great accessories you can pair it with to really help you get the most from the phone.

Here, we&#039;ve rounded up some of the best ones that are worth your time.



Razer Rugged Case



Don&#039;t let the name fool you into thinking this is some gargantuan monstrosity that&#039;ll make your already large phone even larger. The Rugged Case by Razer is tough, and it&#039;ll take care of the phone, but calling it truly rugged is a stretch.

What it is, is probably the nicest case you&#039;ll find for the Razer Phone right now. On the outside, it&#039;s a tough polycarbonate, and on the inside a soft (and very green) TPU lining.

It protects the whole top of the phone along with both sides bar cutouts for the power button and the volume ke...</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Razer Rugged Case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-razer-phone&quot; title=&quot;Best Accessories for Razer Phone&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2018/03/razerphone-ruggedcrop.png?itok=5Di8WV0g&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&#039;t let the name fool you into thinking this is some gargantuan monstrosity that&#039;ll make your already large phone even larger. The Rugged Case by Razer is tough, and it&#039;ll take care of the phone, but calling it truly rugged is a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it is, is probably the nicest case you&#039;ll find for the Razer Phone right now. On the outside, it&#039;s a tough polycarbonate, and on the inside a soft (and very green) TPU lining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It protects the whole top of the phone along with both sides bar cutouts for the power button and the volume keys. The entire bottom is open, which is good because my experience with cases has had mixed results in the USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter fitting properly with cases that just offer a small cutout around the charging port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a little pricey at $40, but it looks great and naturally you&#039;ll find Razer&#039;s familiar logo on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293382-12125361%3Fsid%3DUUacUdUnU66047YYr%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.razerzone.com%252Fmobile%252Frazer-phone-rugged-case&amp;amp;token=sgnnIDGx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot;&gt;See at Razer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Anker PowerCore II 10,000mAh battery pack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-razer-phone&quot; title=&quot;Best Accessories for Razer Phone&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2018/03/powercore-2-10000.jpg?itok=cJAjQD_J&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a 4,000mAh battery inside the Razer Phone, it&#039;s not that likely you&#039;ll be going hunting for a charger before the end of the day. But, if you&#039;re a mobile gamer that&#039;s going to be away from an outlet for some time, you might need a little top up lest your VainGlory grind be interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Razer Phone supports QuickCharge 4.0, but there don&#039;t seem to be any battery packs out there built for this yet. Instead, you should turn to a respected brand, and Anker&#039;s PowerCore batteries are about the best you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 10000mAh battery pack is far from the biggest you can get, but it&#039;ll charge your Razer Phone twice, has a high power output and most of all, is small enough to fit in a pocket. And with a QuickCharge wall adapter, you can charge the whole thing back up in just 4 hours. And it&#039;s only $30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Ultra-Compact-10000mAh-Compatible/dp/B072MH1434/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU66047YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Razer Hammerhead USB-C headphones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-razer-phone&quot; title=&quot;Best Accessories for Razer Phone&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brb/public/field/image/2018/02/hammerhead-usbc-2.jpg?itok=a5Lvmcr3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no 3.5mm jack on the Razer Phone, you&#039;ll be living that dongle life if you want to hook up your favorite set of headphones. But however good the THX DAC in the dongle may be, it&#039;s still something you can, and probably will, lose pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to get a set of USB-C powered headphones and Razer makes its own that sound pretty darn good. They&#039;re comfortable, with a selection of tips to get a good fit, offer a decent amount of passive sound isolation, an inline remote, tangle-free cable and an included carry case. Oh, and they light up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&#039;re a fairly hefty investment at $80 but offer a great package and are about 100 times more convenient than carrying a dongle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Samsung 128GB MicroSD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-razer-phone&quot; title=&quot;Best Accessories for Razer Phone&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2018/03/81jps9hc3ll._sl1500_.jpg?itok=dMR0IXuN&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;64GB of internal storage is great, and it&#039;s probably the minimum you&#039;d expect to find in a high-end phone right now, but when it comes to storage, can you ever really have enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Razer Phone accepts a microSD card and while there are &lt;em&gt;a ton&lt;/em&gt; out there and frequent deals, one brand I always come back to is Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 128GB microSD card will add twice as much storage again to your Razer Phone for a small outlay of just $40. And with 100MB/s and 90MB/s read and write speeds, it&#039;s got the performance to match your superfast phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MicroSD-Adapter-MB-ME128GA-AM/dp/B06XWZWYVP/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU66047YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8Bitdo SF30 Pro controller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-razer-phone&quot; title=&quot;Best Accessories for Razer Phone&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2017/11/8bitdo-pro-1-cail.jpg?itok=tpatuAGo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you bought a Razer Phone there&#039;s a good chance you like to game. There are some tremendous games out there with superb touchscreen controls, but sometimes, you just want a controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best options you can get right now to use with a mobile device is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/8bitdo-sf30-and-sn30-pro-gamepad&quot;&gt;8Bitdo SF30 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. What makes it so good? It&#039;s basically a clone of the legendary SNES controller but with a modern day upgrade, so you get triggers and a pair of analog sticks. But it feels mostly like the original, and that&#039;s just great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s an optional phone clip to mount the phone to the controller, but if you use it with the Razer Phone you may have to put the phone off center so as not to interfere with the volume buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also comes in two color schemes: Purple to match the NA model SNES and multi-colored to match Japan and Europe. Both are $50 a piece but they can be used with a PC, Mac or iOS device as well as your Razer Phone, so they&#039;re really versatile controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aukey braided USB-C Cable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yawn, a USB cable? I don&#039;t care if it is braided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is your reaction, don&#039;t be too hasty. The Razer Phone comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box that&#039;s perfectly fine for charging it from the included wall adapter. But what if you want to charge from your PC or laptop, or a portable battery pack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most of these cases right now you probably don&#039;t have USB-C ports available, and even if you do, having additional cables is always useful. In this case, it comes from a respectable brand, Aukey, only costs $8 and means you can plug your phone into anything with a normal USB-A port.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei Mate SE launches in the U.S. as a more powerful Honor 7X for $249</title>

    <description>$50 more gets you an extra 1GB of RAM and twice as much storage.

If you want to buy a solid Android phone without spending a ton of cash, one of your best options is currently the Honor 7X. The 7X offers a modern design with commendable specs at a great price, and now U.S. consumers get to choose between it and its new cousin &amp;ndash; the Huawei Mate SE.



For all intents and purposes, the Huawei Mate SE is the Honor 7X with slightly upgraded internals, a tweaked design for the rear camera housing, and Huawei branding in favor of Honor&#039;s.

The Huawei Mate SE shares much of the Honor 7X&#039;s spec sheet, including its 5.93-inch 1080p display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, Kirin 659 processor, 3,340 mAh battery, and 16MP + 2 MP rear camera combo. However, where the Honor 7X has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, the Huawei Mate SE bumps these up to 4GB and 64GB, respectively.

    <title>Galaxy S9 vs Galaxy S9+: Which is best for VR?</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s9-vs-galaxy-s9-which-best-vr</link>
    <description>The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ have top of the line specs, but they have different advantages when it comes to VR.



Samsung&#039;s Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ feature top of the line specs, beautiful designs, and improve upon the successful Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. While both of Samsung&#039;s newest flagship devices have many similarities, there are some differences when it comes to using them with a Gear VR. There are pros and cons to each so you&#039;ll have to weigh them yourself before deciding which phone is best for you.

Samsung Galaxy S9 vs. Galaxy S9+: Which should you buy?

Pixel power



Samsung&#039;s flagships are known for having beautiful displays, and the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ are no exceptions. Both have 2960x1440 pixel displays. But since the phones are different sizes, the pixel densities differ. The Galaxy S9 has a pixel density of 570 pixels per inch while the Galaxy S9+ has a pixel density of 529 pixels per inch. This isn&#039;t as noticeable when you&#039;re using your phone in your hand, b...</description>

&lt;p&gt;Samsung&#039;s flagships are known for having beautiful displays, and the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ are no exceptions. Both have 2960x1440 pixel displays. But since the phones are different sizes, the pixel densities differ. The Galaxy S9 has a pixel density of 570 pixels per inch while the Galaxy S9+ has a pixel density of 529 pixels per inch. This isn&#039;t as noticeable when you&#039;re using your phone in your hand, but is a bigger deal when using your phone in the Gear VR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a phone with a Gear VR, you can see what&#039;s called &quot;the screen door effect&quot; where you see grid lines from the display of your phone. While Oculus has made efforts to lessen this effect, it&#039;s more pronounced on devices with lower pixel densities. If you want the absolute best image quality in Gear VR, you should look at the Galaxy S9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Battery Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s9-vs-galaxy-s9-which-best-vr&quot; title=&quot;Galaxy S9 vs Galaxy S9+: Which is best for VR?&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/gear-vr-usb-c-plugged-in.jpg?itok=LEFJhnBO&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the factors that affect battery life for handheld usage of phones don&#039;t affect phones while in VR. When you place your phone into the Gear VR, a large portion of the screen turns black since the VR experience only relies on the two circles that are on your screen. Since the Galaxy S9 and S9+ both have AMOLED displays, these black pixels don&#039;t drain battery life which means the larger screen of the Galaxy S9+ isn&#039;t a battery drain in VR. These phones don&#039;t have the exact same amount of screen used while in VR, but it&#039;s close enough that the battery drain of VR is about the same for each device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the largest factor for battery life using a Gear VR is the size of your phone&#039;s battery. The Galaxy S9 has a 3000mAh battery while the Galaxy S9+ has a 3500mAH battery. This means that your VR sessions will drain last longer on the Galaxy S9+ unless you want to plug in your Gear VR while using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vrheads.com/everything-you-can-do-usb-port-your-gear-vr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta large&quot;&gt;Everything you can do with the USB port on your Samsung Gear VR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Which is best for VR?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s9-vs-galaxy-s9-which-best-vr&quot; title=&quot;Galaxy S9 vs Galaxy S9+: Which is best for VR?&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/gear-vr-looking-left.jpg?itok=XWDb36f6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these phones have the same processors, and many of the same internals which means the main deciding factors when it comes to using them with a Gear VR are pixel density and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galaxy S9 has a higher pixel density which will result in a more immersive VR experience, but its battery is smaller than the Galaxy S9+. Considering that these devices both support rapid charging and that you can plug your Gear VR in while using it, pixel density is probably more important than battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you&#039;ll be able to enjoy VR using either the Galaxy S9 or Galaxy S9+, the Galaxy S9 offers a better overall package when it comes to virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nest Thermostat Gen 1 through Gen 3 and Nest E: Comparison and main differences</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-gen-1-vs-gen-2-vs-gen-3-comparison-and-main-differences</link>
    <description>

See what changed from the first Nest to the current model.

Nest is a company that&#039;s been around a while and since the debut in 2011, there have been three generations of hardware. Because a thermostat is something we tend to keep once we buy one there are plenty of older generation units in use and for sale used. While the changes between them aren&#039;t as drastic as what we would see in a smartphone, there are some differences worth talking about.

We&#039;ll start by talking about what hasn&#039;t changed: the overall user experience. When Google bought Nest Labs many were worried that there would be significant &quot;over-engineering&quot; and extra features added that take away from the simple and efficient experience Next delivers. Thankfully, that didn&#039;t happen and using a first generation Nest feels very much like using a third generation Nest, even though there are some substantial changes in functionality and compatibility.

&lt;p&gt;Each generation has a different diameter and thickness, though the differences are very slight. One of the external differences you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; easily see is in the trim ring. A gen 1 Nest has a two part ring in stainless steel, and a gen 3 Nest can have a copper, white or black ring. Another external difference is the size of the display, with the generation 3 Nest having a larger (.5 inch difference in diameter) touch screen that the previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&#039;t have to break out any measuring tools to tell which Nest is on your wall. Just open the Nest app, choose your thermostat and in the upper right corner tap the gear icon to open the settings. Under &lt;strong&gt;Technical Info&lt;/strong&gt; you&#039;ll see the &lt;strong&gt;Display Model&lt;/strong&gt; listing. The first digit in the model number corresponds with the hardware version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Here is a quick overview of the main differences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes in gen 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference from the first generation to the second was equipment support. When Nest first arrived it was compatible with approximately 75% of heating and cooling systems in use. That means there were a sizeable number of people who couldn&#039;t use a Nest. Gen 2 brought that number to 95% by adding an extra pair of connectors. The new inputs added support for hybrid heat installations and humidistats in addition to 1-2 stage cooling and 1-3 stage heating systems. One last change made it possible to control 24 volts equipment without a common wire back to the thermostat. These changes made it possible to use a Nest thermostat on advanced HVAC systems found in the newest homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big pull left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Generation 2 brought support for more advanced installations and a more custom setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen 2 Nest thermostats also introduced System Match. System Match determines the wiring connection then asks you a few questions during the installation. This lets Nest tune other features specifically for your setup rather than treat every installation as a standard forced-air system and makes us more comfortable while saving money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional features introduced with gen 2 include Early On mode for cold mornings, filter change reminders and a True Radiant mode that helps the thermostat determine exactly how much heat is being created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes in gen 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest visible difference between previous models and the generation 3 model is the display. With gen 3 we see a bigger 480 by 480 touchscreen at 229 pixels per inch. This makes it easier to see information across the room so you don&#039;t need to open the app on your phone or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big pull right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Generation 3 brings a better display and support for water boilers as well as more colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not readily seen but more important are some additional features. Gen 3 Nests can control a water boiler if you have one in your HVAC system. Just like other environmental controls through Nest software you can set limits and schedules for when the boiler is heated and a peak water setting is useful as an override if you have guests or need to use some extra hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen 3 also has what Nest calls Farsight. Using special sensors your thermostat can tell when someone enters a room or walks past from up to 5 meters away. There are several things you can display on the screen when a person is sensed, including a clock or a weather widget. Nest users coming home from work can see the current indoor temperature as soon as they walk into the house. You&#039;ll know at a glance if you need to adjust the temperature if you arrive earlier than scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Nest E&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-gen-1-vs-gen-2-vs-gen-3-comparison-and-main-differences&quot; title=&quot;Nest Thermostat Gen 1 through Gen 3 and Nest E: Comparison and main differences&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/09/nest-thermostat-e-review2-11.jpg?itok=G5k61eQS&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Nest debut the newest model in the thermostat line, the Nest E. The most notable change from the Learning Thermostat model is, of course, the price, but there a few other differences between the gen 3 Learning Thermostat and the Thermostat E that you need to know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Industrial design versus minimalism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design shows some obvious differences as well as two that aren&#039;t quite so obvious. The Learning Thermostat comes with multiple color options for the metal trim ring, while the Thermostat E comes in plastic white only. The display on the Thermostat E is smaller in both physical size and resolution, but it&#039;s also covered with a polarized barrier that hides the edge of the display and slightly blurs the display. This helps the thermostat look like it blends into your wall a bit better, and the effect is really pleasing &amp;mdash; I wish my Learning Thermostat was built to look this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;There is no Farsight support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as features go, the Thermostat E does everything the Learning Thermostat does except support Farsight. Farsight is the feature that allows the Learning Thermostat to detect and analyze motion at a distance. The display will light up when it notices you walk by, and the Learning Thermostat has a significantly longer range because of Farsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farsight does more than light up the screen. It&#039;s also used to know when you or anyone else is in the house versus when you&#039;re away, and that&#039;s a big part of the automatic learning a Nest is capable of. It&#039;s also a hindrance if you use a manually set schedule and have pets who can be seen by Farsight and will override your set schedule or throw a wrench into the works when the Nest is learning on its own; it can think you&#039;re home because it saw the dog mosey over to get a drink from his/her bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farsight is an amazing bit of tech, but it also isn&#039;t perfect for everyone. Just know that it&#039;s not an option on the Thermostat E before you buy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gen 3 Learning Thermostat works with over 95% of all heating and cooling systems, including some pretty obscure methods like radiant geothermal passive air systems. With the Nest E, that&#039;s been downgraded to &quot;most 24V heating and cooling systems.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that most &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; means most. The Nest E is going to work for almost every home in the Americas out of the box. A thermostat is really only a switch that toggles based on the temperature, and regardless of what style of environmental controls you have in your home, the thermostat is still just a low voltage switch. Where things get tricky is when you need to trigger multiple switches to turn on things like auxiliary equipment or multi-stage equipment, and the Nest E is going to be able to work with &quot;most&quot; of those systems, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which Nest you&#039;re thinking of buying, you should use &lt;a href=&quot;https://nest.com/thermostats/nest-thermostat-e/tech-specs/#works/?mode=buy&quot;&gt;this compatibility checker&lt;/a&gt; to know if it will work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nest Thermostat is a great way to keep your house at the temperature you want and save money while doing it. It&#039;s reasonably simple to install yourself (professional installation is about $125 if you want to go that way) and works with almost every heating and cooling setup. With full control from your phone or Amazon Echo and Google Home, it&#039;s a great first step for an automated lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo vs. Dot vs. Tap vs. Spot vs. Show: Which should you buy?</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-which-should-you-buy</link>
    <description>Which Amazon Echo is best for you? I have no idea. But here&#039;s how I&#039;d approach each one.

I own too many Amazon Echo speakers. From the original Echo to the Echo Dot and the newfangled Echo Show with its screen and camera. Plus the Amazon Tap, and Echo Look, which you can&#039;t even buy without an invitation. (And you probably shouldn&#039;t but it, for reasons I&#039;ll get into in a second.)

This isn&#039;t a cookie-cutter list of all the Echo speakers and why you should buy them. Hell, a couple I think you probably should stay away from. This is a list of how I see things after having used them all for months and months. Hit the links below to jump on down to the Echo that tickles your fancy.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/em&gt;: The best Amazon Echo for starting out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-body__video&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video_iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/MZxcK37I41A?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-mzxck37i41a&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start simple. If you&#039;re just not sure about this whole Alexa thing and really don&#039;t know how much you&#039;ll get out of an Amazon Echo, it&#039;s best to not spend a lot of money. Start with an Echo Dot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Echo Dot costs $49 retail, but it&#039;s not uncommon to see it on sale for as low as $30. And at that price it&#039;s kind of a no-brainer. Buy one and give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pro tip here is to buy more than one at a time. Amazon typically has deals if you buy multiple Echoes Dot at one time &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;$20 is the usual savings. So if you&#039;re like me and you know you&#039;ll want to stash a few of these around the house, save yourself a few bucks and take advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-body__video&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video_iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/r450M4j3Pd0?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-r450m4j3pd0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--/video--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo&quot;&gt;completely redesigned the basic Echo for 2017&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;s shorter than the original and more squat in stature. And you can get one clad in fabric for $99. That&#039;s not a bad buy, and it&#039;s what I&#039;d recommend for someone who wants to get something better than the Dot, but still not spend more than a hundred bucks. The sound quality is decent for that price. Can you get something better? Yeah. But not for less money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to spend a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more, though, $119 will get you a new Echo with a wood veneer, or in matte plastic. I&#039;ve found the fabric to be plenty good, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-echo-speaker-with-wifi-alexa-dark-charcoal/dp/B06XCM9LJ4?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU53987YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;plus&quot; id=&quot;plus&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Plus:&lt;/em&gt; The best-sounding Echo yet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-which-should-you-buy&quot; title=&quot;Amazon Echo vs. Dot vs. Tap vs. Spot vs. Show: Which should you buy?&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/11/amazon-echo-plus-review-2017-12.jpg?itok=De3eVviz&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon decided to keep the tried and true Echo design, but give it better internals. That gives us the $149 Echo Plus. It sounds a little better than the previous-generation Echo, and definitely better than the current 2017 model. It comes in the same matte plastic, but now you can get silver in addition to black and white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new for the Echo Plus is the ability to serve as a smart home hub &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;if the devices you&#039;re looking to support use Zigbee to connect. (You&#039;re forgiven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/what-zigbee-and-zwave&quot;&gt;if you don&#039;t know what Zigbee is&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; it&#039;s not something an end user should ever have to worry about.) It likely won&#039;t solve all your smart home problems, but it&#039;s a nice little addition nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075RWFCHB/ref_=fs_ods_fs_aucc_sr?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU53987YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;spot&quot; id=&quot;spot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Spot&lt;/em&gt;: An expensive, but cool, bedside Echo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-body__video&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video_iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/1Zf3SwAdJ0Y?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-1zf3swadj0y&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--/video--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take the &lt;a href=&quot;#show&quot;&gt;Echo Show&lt;/a&gt; and shrink it down, this is what you&#039;d get. It&#039;s a $130 Echo clock with a decent (but not overly great) speaker and a 2.5-inch display. You&#039;ll get the time, of course, along with weather information and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-amazon-screw-echo-shows-best-feature-bad&quot;&gt;the same semi-useful headlines&lt;/a&gt; as on the Echo Show. Plus it&#039;ll make phone calls and video chat with other Spots or Shows. (Yes, that means there&#039;s a camera pointed into your bedroom.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great-looking device, but it&#039;s not inexpensive, and it&#039;s only $10 less than the much larger Echo Show, which will be better for the video it can still display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-VN94DQ-Echo-Spot-White/dp/B073SRJD46?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU53987YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;tap&quot; id=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Tap&lt;/em&gt;: Smaller, portable, expensive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-which-should-you-buy&quot; title=&quot;Amazon Echo vs. Dot vs. Tap vs. Spot vs. Show: Which should you buy?&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2017/08/amazon-tap-press-image.jpg?itok=nyKY9Kkl&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, this isn&#039;t an &quot;Echo&quot; device. It&#039;s &quot;Alexa-enabled.&quot; OK. (Maybe it&#039;s because the &quot;Alexa&quot; hotword isn&#039;t enabled by default, and instead you&#039;re supposed to push the microphone button.) But no matter. For all intents and purposes it&#039;s an Echo, and it&#039;s meant to be portable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tap has a charging base that allows you to just pick up the speaker and take it wherever you want. And it sounds decent. Not great, but good. Good enough for $129 retail, though? Eh, now Amazon is starting to ask a lot &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;particularly when you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M5EQLJI/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU53987YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;get a portable battery base for the original Echo&lt;/a&gt; for just $50 and get a much better speaker for your troubles. Or you could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cordless-Speaker-Portable-Battery-Ash/dp/B071XSGFLJ?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU53987YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stick an Echo Dot in this little cordless speaker&lt;/a&gt; and get a decent experience &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;again, for just $50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don&#039;t really see the necessity of a portable Alexa speaker &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;especially since the speaker itself is going to need to be connected to the Internet at all times for the Alexa stuff to work. And hotspotting to your phone just isn&#039;t something I want to bother with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your money probably is better off with any other Echo &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;or just a traditional Bluetooth speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BH83OOM?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU53987YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;show&quot; id=&quot;show&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Show&lt;/em&gt;: Will it ever get better?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-body__video&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video_iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/7ZTqct7fPSA?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-7ztqct7fpsa&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--/video--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an early fan of the Echo Show &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;the potential for an Alexa-enabled device with a large touchscreen is enormous. Unfortunately, it&#039;s yet to pan out in the first few months. The headlines you get are pure fluff, with very little actual news, if ever &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;and Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-amazon-screw-echo-shows-best-feature-bad&quot;&gt;says it&#039;s done this on purpose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Google decided to not let YouTube videos play on the Echo Show &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;likely because Amazon&#039;s implementation was doing so without advertising. That &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-amazon-screw-echo-shows-best-feature-bad&quot;&gt;killed one of the few reasons&lt;/a&gt; I&#039;d actually recommend the Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&#039;s the fact that very few Alexa Skills actually take advantage of the display in the first place. It&#039;s a novelty at this point, not a necessity &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;even though making video calls on the Echo Show is still a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24C0TI/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU53987YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;look&quot; id=&quot;look&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Look&lt;/em&gt;: How much do you care about what you wear?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-body__video&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video_iframe&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/A0Ge7OaAsHg?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-a0ge7oaashg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--/video--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a pretty good chance you shouldn&#039;t buy the Echo Look. Unless you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; care about fashion &amp;mdash; to the point that you want to take a picture of what you&#039;re wearing and send it to Amazon for cataloging and analysis &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;then you&#039;ll just want to ignore this. For that&#039;s what Echo Look is good at. It&#039;s got a camera and its own app for taking your picture from head to toe, and it does a nice job of highlighting you while downplaying everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there it lets you flip back through what you&#039;ve worn day after day, and you can have it compare two outfits and decide which it thinks looks better on you. (To varying degrees of success, I found.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You very much will get out of Echo Look what you put into it. I don&#039;t care so much about what I&#039;m wearing, so this wasn&#039;t really $200 well spent for me. Your wardrobe mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to be fair, you can&#039;t just go out and buy an Echo Look. You&#039;ll have to tell Amazon you&#039;re interested in it, and then wait for an invitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0186JAEWK?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU53987YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated March 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Added Phil&#039;s video review for the Echo Spot. It&#039;s cute. And it&#039;s only $10 less than the Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>Available now across 66 countries.

You&#039;ll be able to use Deezer on all of Amazon&#039;s own Echo devices, and if you own something like a Sonos One or another speaker that uses Alexa but isn&#039;t made by Amazon, you&#039;re also fully covered.

    <title>Google Clips review: A thing that exists</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips-review</link>
    <description>This weird square might be the coolest thing Google has done in a long time.



&quot;Okay, but what is it?&quot; my friend asked for the third time during my description of the small teal square I was now actively fidgeting with. This was the third time during this party I&#039;d run into this same problem. Someone will catch me setting Google Clips up somewhere in the room, shoot me a quizzical look, and when I didn&#039;t offer an immediate answer ask what I was up to. My friends are all used to me bringing some new gadget to a party to play with, whether it&#039;s a 1W blue laser that looks like a lightsaber or a VR rig to show people what it&#039;s like to shoot zombies drunk.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips-review&quot; title=&quot;Google Clips review: A thing that exists&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/google-clips-pixel.jpg?itok=EfA5ugOM&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Okay, but what is it?&quot; my friend asked for the third time during my description of the small teal square I was now actively fidgeting with. This was the third time during this party I&#039;d run into this same problem. Someone will catch me setting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips&quot;&gt;Google Clips&lt;/a&gt; up somewhere in the room, shoot me a quizzical look, and when I didn&#039;t offer an immediate answer ask what I was up to. My friends are all used to me bringing some new gadget to a party to play with, whether it&#039;s a 1W blue laser that looks like a lightsaber or a VR rig to show people what it&#039;s like to shoot zombies drunk. Yet this time, with nothing but this small camera from Google in my hand, I found myself unable to offer a simple answer that would satisfy the person asking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long answers for what Google Clips is I can handle. Clips is a camera from Google with AI baked in to take pictures and videos automatically. You set it somewhere in the middle of something interesting, and when you come back for it later there will be memories captured you otherwise would not have been able to capture. It&#039;s not a constant recording; you only get the bits Google&#039;s AI thinks were important. It&#039;s a camera you have basically no control over, so you can enjoy the event you are supposed to be enjoying instead of walking around with your phone in front of your face the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explanation begged an important follow-up, which takes even more time to explain. &quot;Does it work?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DJAF5WzpxbKM%26mid%3D38606%26u1%3DUUacUdUnU66035YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fgoogle-clips-white%252F6133307.p%253FskuId%253D6133307&amp;amp;token=9ObBNUv9&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot;&gt;See at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips-review&quot; title=&quot;Google Clips review: A thing that exists&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/google-clips-hero.jpg?itok=C1JFIfSs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;micro&quot;&gt;The Automatic Camera&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Clips &lt;em&gt;Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s really not much to Google Clips. It&#039;s a little square that fits in the palm of your hand, with a camera lens on one side and little else. There&#039;s a USB-C port for charging, a single physical button under the lens, and three LEDs under the white plastic to let you know when the camera is on and doing something. To turn it on, you twist the lens and wait for the lights to pulse. Once that happens, you put the camera somewhere and leave it. That really is it, your job as the human is complete. The rest is up to the AI, Google is the photographer here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips-review&quot; title=&quot;Google Clips review: A thing that exists&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2018/03/science-clips.gif?itok=3bRLnyKs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google&#039;s software seems to work in a couple of different ways. If the camera detects a ton of motion, it will save a clip of whatever just happened. If multiple faces are detected, it will save a clip of whatever just happened. Basically, the camera is always recording but only &lt;em&gt;saves&lt;/em&gt; the stuff it thinks you will find interesting. All of this is done locally, with no connection to your phone or your data required. As &quot;smart&quot; things with cameras on them go, it&#039;s remarkably privacy-focused. You are the only one with access to the photos and video captured by Clips. The AI heavy lifting all happens locally, and you can extract photos and video without ever being connected to the internet. The recorded content isn&#039;t stored to your phone or in Google Photos unless you explicitly give permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that having been said, Google offers a way to &quot;train&quot; the camera to give you more things you might be interested in. If you sync your People and Pets collection from Google Photos, Clips will have a library of faces it knows are important to you. When one of those faces are detected, it will record ever it previously might not have. You can also manipulate Clips by using the physical button on the front of the camera. Use it to take a photo of someone, and Clips will identify that person as a priority for future recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera itself is interesting. It&#039;s a 12MP sensor with an &amp;fnof;/2.4 aperture and a 130-degree Field of View (FoV) lens, which means everything it captures is &lt;em&gt;wide&lt;/em&gt;. This presents an interesting challenge for getting photos and video you actually want to see. If you place the camera on a surface somewhere at the edge of a room, it will capture the whole room with no problem but everyone will appear far away. If you place the camera too close to the action, it risks getting knocked over or not being in the right place if the subject moves. The solution, for the most part, is to use the Live View mode in the Google Clips app so you can temporarily see what the camera sees to ensure the best placement. The inherent problem with that solution, however, is you are now using your phone to control a camera designed to encourage you to put your phone down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its 16GB of onboard storage and the promise of three straight hours of &quot;smart capture&quot; Clips is designed to live long enough to capture memories from your average kids party. The onboard storage allows you to store up to 1400 files with no problem, so you can recharge and capture without being concerned you need to sort through these memories until later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips-review&quot; title=&quot;Google Clips review: A thing that exists&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/google-clips-app.jpg?itok=sfJ36PH8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;micro&quot;&gt;Maybe a little too simple, but good at what it does&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Clips &lt;em&gt;Software&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the party has ended and you&#039;re ready to wind down, you can open the Clips app on your phone and see what it captured. The app syncs to the camera even if it hasn&#039;t been used in hours, as long as it is nearby. Once connected, you have two options for browsing. There&#039;s the unfiltered list of 21-second video clips the camera caught, and there&#039;s the AI-enhanced edits which only focus on the things it found the most interesting. As you scroll through either list, the top file will auto-play so you get a quick look at what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull left big&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The results are something you and your friends and family are guaranteed to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, you have a couple of options. You can save the file straight to your phone, where it will appear as a Pixel-style Motion Photo and backed up to Google Photos. You can pick a single frame out of the video to save as just a photo, where it can be edited like any other photo. Or, my personal favorite, you can edit the file right on the camera. The edit tool in the Clips app lets you crop as you see fit, trim the video length as you see fit, and then save to your phone as either a photo or video or gif. Saving as a gif works exactly like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/ar-stickers-and-new-user-interface-come-googles-motion-stills&quot;&gt;Motion Stills app&lt;/a&gt; from Google, which is both familiar and a little confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its 12MP camera, Google Clips exported in a wild variety of ways I had little control over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GIF - 0.3MP or 640x480&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motion Photo - 6MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video - 2.3MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For comparison, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2&quot;&gt;Pixel 2&lt;/a&gt; will capture 8MP motion stills with the front-facing camera without issue. The app has some basic controls for image quality if you want to record something nicer, and those settings were cranked all the way up to High for these clips. That means the image and video sizes can be considerably smaller, which naturally also means quality takes a hit. That&#039;s an issue, because image quality is already questionable in a lot of situations for this camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips-review&quot; title=&quot;Google Clips review: A thing that exists&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2018/03/oculus-clips.gif?itok=jKoR1ay3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;fnof;/2.4 aperture means it struggles a bit in low light or variable light, but Google&#039;s AI does quite a bit to clean up noise before presenting the image to you. This isn&#039;t the kind of thing I would rely on outdoors at night, but in a dimly-lit room or a room where all of the light is shining right at the camera I found the captured photos and videos were okay but clearly nowhere near as good as the top cameras available on phones today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this app does, it does well. There&#039;s really not a whole lot you&#039;re &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to do, if the whole point is to set up a camera and become part of the experience. Personally I&#039;d prefer the ability to edit directly in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos&quot;&gt;Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;. Right now you have to jump around from the Clips app to Photos and back if you want to make edits to something you&#039;ve saved. If I&#039;m already syncing my data from Photos to this camera, it&#039;d be nice to have an &quot;edit in Photos&quot; option that takes the image I&#039;m playing with straight to the app to be edited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips-review&quot; title=&quot;Google Clips review: A thing that exists&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/google-clips-monster.jpg?itok=AIjuWYVB&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;micro&quot;&gt;Is this supposed to be so much work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Clips &lt;em&gt;Experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have four kids running around my house and I love going to small gatherings with my friends. On a high level, Clips seems like it was built for me. To be able to get out from behind the camera and participate without losing the opportunity to capture what could be a precious memory is right up my alley. Google Clips &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; deliver that experience, and when it does the end results are fantastic. But it&#039;s not quite as automatic or seamless as it probably could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the week that I used Clips, I found myself constantly hunting for the best place to put it so it could record things. Parties often happen in multiple rooms, so I would have to move the camera to where the people are to get the things I wanted. Each time this happened, I went from being the active participant in the party to the passive observer and event documentary host. Several of the things Clips recorded were of me trying to position Clips, and on more than once occasion my big dumb face happened to be blocking part of a really cool thing that was happening behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like I said, when it works the results are something you and your friends and family are guaranteed to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-clips-review&quot; title=&quot;Google Clips review: A thing that exists&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/2018/03/candles-clips.gif?itok=2fWJS-II&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a collection of memories from Clips that I either couldn&#039;t have or wouldn&#039;t have captured, and that&#039;s cool. Over time I got used to the &quot;frame&quot; for Google Clips and didn&#039;t have to reply on the live view in the app as much, but there was never a point where I found myself truly setting the camera up and forgetting about it. It&#039;s the kind of thing that makes me wonder if I&#039;m a fan of Google Clips because I like the underlying idea, or if I&#039;m a fan because it&#039;s actually delivering on its promise and making me more present and focused on the moment in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, this thing I have trouble describing is an incredible exploration of what we think about when taking photos. I enjoy the way Clips has challenged the way I think about what I capture and how, and find myself eager to explore this camera a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Should you buy it? &lt;em&gt;It Depends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DJAF5WzpxbKM%26mid%3D38606%26u1%3DUUacUdUnU66035YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fgoogle-clips-white%252F6133307.p%253FskuId%253D6133307&amp;amp;token=9ObBNUv9&quot;&gt;$250&lt;/a&gt;, Google Clips is expensive. This is something you buy if you want to try a new way to take photos, not something you buy if you want the best possible photo or if you enjoy the act of taking photos. Google is the photographer with this product, and if that is an idea which excites you I would recommend picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Lens is now available for all Android users through Google Photos</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens-now-available-all-android-users-through-google-photos</link>
    <description>Select Android phones will also be able to access lens via the Assistant.

When the Pixel 2 launched last October, one of its exclusive software features was Google Lens. Today, Google Lens is escaping the clutches of the Pixel brand and expanding to all Android devices through the Google Photos app.



To access Google Lens, simply open Google Photos, select the picture you want to use, and then tap the Lens icon that&#039;s in between the trash and edit options. Once you do this, Google Lens will scan your picture and show any information that&#039;s relevant to it.

Google Lens can currently identify buildings/landmarks, company logos, cat/dog breeds, text, paintings, movies, etc.

In addition to this, Google also announced at MWC 2018 that certain phones from Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, LG, Nokia, and Sony would be able to access Lens via the Google Assistant. There&#039;s still no ETA as to when that&#039;ll happen, but in the meantime, Google Photos has your back to get your Lens fix.

    <title>Galaxy S9+ vs. Galaxy Note 8: Which should you buy?</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-note-8-vs-galaxy-s9</link>
    <description>



Samsung fans will be torn between these two.

Samsung&#039;s dual-flagship approach is great for smartphone super-fans, because we get to see a new top-of-the-line phone from the company twice a year. The Galaxy S series refreshes early on in the year, followed by a Note phone about six months later.

But for someone who holds off on a purchase and doesn&#039;t necessarily upgrade every six months (or even each year), it creates a quandary when you go to buy a Samsung phone: do you buy the Galaxy S, or the Note? Right now you can get the Galaxy Note 8, which is still just a handful of months old and very much a modern phone, but if you want the absolute latest tech from Samsung it has actually been supplanted by the Galaxy S9+.

The Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series have converged over the past few years, but it hasn&#039;t ever been this close &amp;mdash; here&#039;s what you need to consider when choosing between the two.

&lt;div class=&quot;media-gallery-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;media-gallery-flat&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-title=&quot;Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 8&quot; data-big=&quot;/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-2.jpg?itok=YFWnEl_7&quot; class=&quot;flat-img &quot; style=&quot;background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-2.jpg?itok=YFWnEl_7);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-title=&quot;Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 8&quot; data-big=&quot;/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-4.jpg?itok=LF2r9uTh&quot; class=&quot;flat-img &quot; style=&quot;background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-4.jpg?itok=LF2r9uTh);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-title=&quot;Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 8&quot; data-big=&quot;/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-3.jpg?itok=ZS4xYSMq&quot; class=&quot;flat-img &quot; style=&quot;background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-3.jpg?itok=ZS4xYSMq);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--/media-gallery-flat--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galaxy S9+ has a few improvements over the Note 8, but as you&#039;d expect considering their proximity much has been carried over. The two phones share a common platform in their hardware when it comes to the quality of the materials and the overall design, with the only real change being the GS9+&#039;s different metal finish. The Galaxy S9+&#039;s display has improved from the GS8+, but is indistinguishable in quality from the Note 8 &amp;mdash; so yeah, both look amazing. And of course there&#039;s just a 0.1-inch diagonal difference in size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;right pull big&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the same core hardware platform supporting both phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the hardware features like waterproofing, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, wireless charging, Quick Charge 2.0 and the supporting specs are all the same. Yes the processor has been upgraded to a Snapdragon 845 in the Galaxy S9+, but that shouldn&#039;t make you forget about the Note 8&#039;s considerable speed in its own right. Both have the same RAM and storage, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the Galaxy S9+ is running &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/oreo&quot;&gt;Oreo&lt;/a&gt; out of the box, I won&#039;t even claim it&#039;s a big difference. The Galaxy Note 8 should have its Oreo update in short order, and it will have as many of the same software features as possible. But even that aside, Samsung&#039;s take on Oreo isn&#039;t all that removed from the Nougat launched on the Note 8 &amp;mdash; all else being equal in the phones, don&#039;t choose one over the other just to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&#039;s different&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;media-gallery-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;media-gallery-flat&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-title=&quot;Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 8&quot; data-big=&quot;/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-5.jpg?itok=avzAr-tu&quot; class=&quot;flat-img &quot; style=&quot;background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-5.jpg?itok=avzAr-tu);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-title=&quot;Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 8&quot; data-big=&quot;/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-1.jpg?itok=fgOgUwaW&quot; class=&quot;flat-img &quot; style=&quot;background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-1.jpg?itok=fgOgUwaW);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-title=&quot;Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 8&quot; data-big=&quot;/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-6.jpg?itok=CW6uCz9-&quot; class=&quot;flat-img &quot; style=&quot;background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-6.jpg?itok=CW6uCz9-);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--/media-gallery-flat--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically, it&#039;s simply a bit easier to handle the slightly smaller Galaxy S9+. We&#039;re talking about 4 mm in height, 1 mm in width and 6 grams in weight, but add it all up with the slightly more rounded corners and the GS9+ feels like less of a behemoth than the Note 8. If the Note 8 is outright unmanageable for you the GS9+ won&#039;t feel like an entirely different phone, and you should consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s9&quot;&gt;regular Galaxy S9&lt;/a&gt; instead &amp;mdash; but I&#039;ll never complain about a phone being smaller and easier to hold, even if it&#039;s subtle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;left pull big&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A slight drop in size and a better fingerprint sensor placement definitely make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more important than the size is the fingerprint sensor placement on the Galaxy S9+. You can easily reach up and touch the lower, center-mounted fingerprint sensor without shifting the phone around in your hand. It&#039;s something you do dozens (perhaps hundreds) of times per day, and it&#039;s something you don&#039;t really think about until you&#039;ve lived with the far inferior placement on the Note 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galaxy S9+ also introduces stereo speakers. A phone the size of the Note 8 really should have them as well, but at least you have access to it with the GS9+. The speakers aren&#039;t dramatically louder, but getting stereo separation and not having the audio easily blocked by your finger when holding the phone in portrait mode is another subtle usability improvement. And yes, the battery on the Galaxy S9+ is slightly larger, 3500 versus 3300mAh. That 6% bump in conjunction with the slight efficiency improvement from the Snapdragon 845 helps battery life, but it&#039;s not a massive shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;right pull big&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note 8&#039;s camera is no slouch, but the Galaxy S9+ easily bests it with no clear downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could say the biggest improvement in the 2018 phone is its main camera. This is an all-new setup for Samsung, with a brand new sensor and a variable aperture. The new sensor is capable of taking fantastic photos with less noise and sharper lines in all sorts of scenes, but really shines when it comes to low light photography. It also has 960 fps super slow-motion video capture, which is a neat trick. The Note 8&#039;s camera is no slouch, but the Galaxy S9+ easily bests it with no clear downsides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only benefit the Note 8 has going for it in this comparison is the feature that gives it its name: the S Pen stylus. If you like to draw or write notes by hand, there isn&#039;t anything like the S Pen on any other phone. Sure the Galaxy S9+ has some of the same features, but when it comes to getting that super-precise input there&#039;s no replacement for having the S Pen at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line: Which should you buy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-note-8-vs-galaxy-s9&quot; title=&quot;Galaxy S9+ vs. Galaxy Note 8: Which should you buy?&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-vs-galaxy-note-8-7.jpg?itok=3GRVYJzW&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really feels like a toss-up. Not only do these two phones have nearly identical experiences, but they also cost about the same. Though the MSRP of the Note 8 was a bit higher, around $940, a few months on the market and the release of the GS9+ has brought that down in many places to the same price as the newer phone. Given their similarities we know basically no one will be upgrading from a Note 8 to a GS9+, but these two &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; be cross-shopped for someone coming from an older phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;right pull big&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unless you need the S Pen, you should buy the Galaxy S9+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much shared between the phones in hardware, design and capabilities, this really comes down to evaluating the few differences and how they&#039;ll actually matter in daily use. The Galaxy S9+ offers a slightly more compact size, a little better battery life, an improved main camera and stereo speakers &amp;mdash; but importantly, it doesn&#039;t make any compromises compared to the Note. The Note 8 offers a tiny bit more room to work on the screen, and obviously the excellent S Pen &amp;mdash; but that&#039;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So either you need a stylus and you buy the Note 8, or you&#039;ll be better served overall by the Galaxy S9+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#spigen&quot;&gt;Spigen Rugged Armor Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;samsung&quot; id=&quot;samsung&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Samsung Alcantara Cover&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-samsung-galaxy-s9&quot; title=&quot;Best Galaxy S9 Accessories&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/samsung-alcantara-cover-s9-press.jpg?itok=i7pMVeoF&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung is one of the few phone makers that really does a great job of supporting their own devices with a solid line of cases. We&#039;ve featured a number of Samsung&#039;s cases in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-galaxy-s9-cases&quot;&gt;round up of the best cases for the Galaxy S9&lt;/a&gt;, but we&#039;ve highlighted the Alcantara Cover here because it was a fantastic option for the Note 8 and should be equally stellar with the S9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcantara is a lightweight material that&#039;s as rugged as the plastic and rubber cases, but offers a very unique look and feel that compliments Samsung&#039;s tall devices. This case deftly covers the edges of the screen but leaves the bottom open for the charging port, headphone jack, and speaker. You can pre-order yours from Samsung for $50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293382-12001245-1428599469000%3Fsid%3DUUacUdUnU66039YYr%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Fmobile%252Fmobile-accessories%252Fphones%252Fgalaxy-s9-alcantara-cover--black-ef-xg960abegus%252F&amp;amp;token=2ApaB__G&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot;&gt;See at Samsung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;spigen&quot; id=&quot;spigen&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spigen Rugged Armor Case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-accessories-samsung-galaxy-s9&quot; title=&quot;Best Galaxy S9 Accessories&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/spigen-rugged-armor-galaxy-s9-press.jpg?itok=diSNNv7V&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s going to be a ton of third-party case options for the Galaxy S9, but for our money you won&#039;t find a better value than the slim Rugged Armor case from Spigen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made of flexible TPU, this case offers a precisely designed shell to keep your S9 protected without adding unnecessary bulk. It&#039;s thin enough to allow wireless charging while still protecting the camera and fingerprint sensor on the back and prevents the display from sitting flush on a table. Get this minimalist case for around $13 on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Flexible-Durable-Absorption-Samsung/dp/B0789S2MPW/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU66039YYr&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Whitestone Dome Glass Tempered Glass Screen Protector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all screen protectors are created equal. If you&#039;re afraid of damaging the Galaxy S9&#039;s curved screen, you should consider the Whitestone Dome Glass screen protector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brand burst onto the scene with the Galaxy S8, offering the best coverage with a tempered glass screen protector we&#039;ve seen. Using a unique liquid adhesion technique that involves uses a UV curing light to ensure a perfect installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the downside is the price. At $45, it&#039;s by far the most expensive screen protector you can buy, but it&#039;s a well-reviewed screen protector that&#039;s backed by a limited lifetime warranty. If you&#039;re concerned about protecting your phone around those curved edges, this is the screen protector you want.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>There&#039;s currently no word on when we can expect it to come out.

At the beginning of December last year, a report emerged claiming that Google was planning on launching its third music streaming service. Currently referred to as &quot;YouTube Remix&quot;, it was expected that this would be unveiled as early as March of this year. However, just ahead of the SXSW music festival, YouTube&#039;s said otherwise.



SXSW will take place between March 9th and the 13th in Austin, Texas, and YouTube&#039;s head of music, Lyor Cohen, will be speaking about &quot;seismic changes he&#039;s witnessed and the importance of embracing the future.&quot;

It was expected that YouTube would use its time at SXSW to unveil the new service, but according to a representative from the company that spoke to Variety:

    <title>Samsung's $100 256GB microSD card is a must-have for all Galaxy S9 owners</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/samsungs-256gb-evo-select-microsd-card-down-100</link>
    <description>Don&#039;t go without it.



Samsung&#039;s 256GB microSD card has only been cheaper once before, and that was during a brief sale on Black Friday. Unless you have a time machine to go back and get that price, this is easily the best deal around on such a large capacity card. SanDisk&#039;s similar option is currently $10 more.

The EVO Select is a Class 10 UHS 3 card, meaning it&#039;s great for storing files, capturing photos, and will even record 4K video without an issue. It has read speeds of up to 100MB/s and write speeds of up to 90MB/s. You can add this card to your smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S9 or S9+, tablet, action camera, PC and more to gain a ton of extra portable storage.

If 256GB is simply too much space for you or you want to spend less, Samsung&#039;s 128GB version of this card is down to just $40 right now.

    <title>Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage</title>
    <link>https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review</link>
    <description>

A game of minigames using PlayStation&#039;s awesome PlayLink, but how fun is it?

Some of the best games are the ones you play with friends, but dive deeper into that genre and sabotage almost always rears its head in the most amazing ways. PlayLink takes your phone and turns it into an incredibly interactive controller feature for your PlayStation, and Frantics uses the ability to put four people and their phones in the same room to cause as much mayhem as possible.

Developers NapNok Games have brought us this goofy title, complete with 15 minigames and a fight for the most crowns. You and four friends will go up against each other to see who will be the reigning winner, but beware, there&#039;s a sleazy fox in the mix trying to cause trouble for the lot of you!

&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;A game of minigames using PlayStation&#039;s awesome PlayLink, but how fun is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the best games are the ones you play with friends, but dive deeper into that genre and sabotage almost always rears its head in the most amazing ways. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-sony-playlink&quot;&gt;PlayLink&lt;/a&gt; takes your phone and turns it into an incredibly interactive controller feature for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-ultimate-guide&quot;&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, and Frantics uses the ability to put four people and their phones in the same room to cause as much mayhem as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-phone-4.jpg?itok=f6rWufGT&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-phone-5.jpg?itok=30ayhyhT&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-phone-3.jpg?itok=Mi6BepUC&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with your own Frantics profile on the app on your phone. Here you&#039;ll &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/best-front-facing-camera&quot;&gt;take a selfie&lt;/a&gt; and it will assign you a goofy animal that will serve as your avatar. Edit any of these by selecting any of the green buttons, as pictured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app itself didn&#039;t give me too many issues and was fairly easy to set up. You &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a minimum of 4 animals playing the minigames. Thankfully for those who want to solo the game in real life, Fox will hook you up with some of his friends should you not have the bodies! Unfortunately, there isn&#039;t an option to play without bots if only you and a single friend are playing, 4 is the lucky number it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The games&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-game-bigtop-hoppity-hop.jpg?itok=c5VOOHYC&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-game-parachuchu.jpg?itok=itxKXOmI&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they say minigames they &lt;em&gt;do mean mini.&lt;/em&gt; Each game will only take 3 minutes &lt;em&gt;tops&lt;/em&gt; to complete, but there are 2-3 rounds per game. It was mildly frustrating that regardless of the game having 15 total minigames it filtered me through the same 3 games a few times to explain how the competition system works. Trust me, the competition system is &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;, but the tutorial seemed to have lagged on longer than it actually did by doing the same thing over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-phone-1.jpg?itok=iZHzRiQR&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, each minigame you play will have a set of rounds to it that will be either timed or ongoing until completion. For instance, the Parachuchu game lasted until all 4 party members hit the ground in one way or another. Then, on the other hand, games like the Big-Top Hippity Hop were timed for who could last the longest. After the goal of the minigame has been completed you will replay the game 2-3 more times and it will gather a final score of the competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that was super cool was the random prizes your host, Fox, would pass out at the end of the matches. The overall winners will receive crowns, but there is also a chance to win some coins by acting up. Deer Dave got a prize for some coins just for being the best &quot;thrasher&quot; because he slammed into other players the most! These prizes are definitely a learn-as-you-go system though, as they aren&#039;t revealed in one way or the other if and when you can earn them, they just happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after your party has played a few of the minigames a final winner will be chosen. When this happens you collect the bragging rights amongst your friends and the game starts over! This means there isn&#039;t really a way to collect hundreds of coins (that I&#039;ve been able to do anyway). That&#039;s not a bad thing either because it keeps the competition constantly refreshed and alive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scandalous, Fox. Just scandalous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-game-parachuchu-2.jpg?itok=YpX16J20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Fox doesn&#039;t just stop at random prizes at the end of the game. Throughout the game, he&#039;ll attempt to ruin your friendships in the most hilarious ways by giving players &quot;Secret Missions&quot; to sabotage their friends. These missions come complete with either goals, powerups or both! Fox will pick the oddball out whether it&#039;s cause you have the least coins or crowns and offer you a back-alley deal to change that for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-phone-6.jpg?itok=ViBSOG8x&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your entertainment comes from playing the games and he comes in to make a game out of you. Where the first minigame round will be held to the full standards of the rules, the next round might have some added bombs to it. Whoever is holding the bomb when it goes off instantly loses the round, but that doesn&#039;t take you from the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losers are given special sabotage options they can use on any one of the other players for as many times as they wish. There is a short cooldown to these options, but not a long one. Deer Dave knocked me out of the race and I made sure he shortly followed by consistently hitting him with a freeze ray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Buy your way to the top&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-fox-winner.jpg?itok=gCQwtIc9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, there are also auctions between minigames. Here Fox will advertise 3 items and each player will get one chance to choose a single item and bid a number on it. If you are the only one to bid, congratulations! You get that item!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you and another player both choose the same item it comes down to who blindly paid the most coins for it. You &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; want to bid all your coins in one go to secure a single power-up, as there will be another auction at the end of the next minigame!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So choose your battles wisely, and keep your battle plans a secret from your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You&#039;re going to want this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-4-frantics-review&quot; title=&quot;Frantics Review: A slippery slope of sabotage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/frantics-fox-select.jpg?itok=whnB-AlI&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&#039;t going to be a scenario here where I tell you this isn&#039;t a game you want. In fact, I absolutely recommend you making this janky Fox your best friend of all time. If you&#039;ve got a family game night or sleepover planned, invite Frantics to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join the experience of laughter and utter hilarious betrayal with your new furry friends, it&#039;s only $19.99 on the PlayStation Store. What are you waiting for?!&lt;/p&gt;
